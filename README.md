# Advertising Budget and Sales Prediction

This project utilizes linear regression to predict sales based on advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads. The dataset contains advertising expenditures and corresponding sales data, and the goal is to train a model to predict sales based on new campaign budgets.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts sales for a new advertising campaign, given the budgets allocated for TV, Radio, and Newspaper ads. The model uses **Linear Regression** for prediction. The dataset is pre-processed and split into training and testing sets. Feature scaling (standardization) is applied to improve model performance.

The model is evaluated using error metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **R² score**.

### Key Highlights:
- **Technology Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **Data**: Advertising expenditure data with TV, Radio, and Newspaper budgets, and corresponding sales.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and processes the dataset, handling data splitting and feature scaling.
- **Linear Regression**: Uses a linear regression model for sales prediction based on advertising budgets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Calculates and prints common error metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² score to evaluate the model's performance.
- **New Campaign Prediction**: Predicts sales based on a given advertising budget (TV, Radio, Newspaper).
